# Dev Helper Scripts

Unless you are making changes to the Dockerfile themselves, please ignore all the files here. In fact, your environment may be very different and these scripts may not work at all. They are provided only as a reference/starting point so you don't have to start from scratch. Heavy customizations are likely.
